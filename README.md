# Indonesia Inflation Forecast

## Overview

This notebook explores several machine learning (ML) methods to improve inflation forecasting in Indonesia. The goal is to forecast general price inflation, based on various macroeconomic factors that affect inflation rate. The data was collected from 2019 to 2024.

This notebook uses Random Forest Regressor, Prophet time series, and Vanilla Neural Network methods to forecast inflation, the best performance model is Vanilla Neural Network with 0.821 RMSE and 26.07% MAPE.

## Notebook Structure

This project divided by two notebook:

1. `1_Wrangling.ipynb`: Consist of loading, exploring, wrangling and cleaning data for machine learning input.
2. `2_Modelling.ipynb`: Consist of preprocessing, modelling and evaluating processes.
